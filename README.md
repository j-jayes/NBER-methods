# NBER-methods
Parse and visualize methods from NBER Abstracts

There is a long tradition of economists being seriously concerned about the methods used to answer their questions, sometimes with even more concern that the answers to their questions. It has been documented since [Richard S. Thorn's *The Methodologies of Economists: A Survey*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40324748?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents).

There is a figure produced by [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2016/11/24/economists-are-prone-to-fads-and-the-latest-is-machine-learning) about the latest fad in the discipline being machine learning.

The figure is constructed in 2016. I want to update it.

## Planning

I want to collect the NBER abstracts over time, and then parse them for different methods, and maybe have a look at the JEL codes over time.

### Packages

Ben Davies from Stanford has created a nice R package that has details about all of the NBER papers. I'll start there.
